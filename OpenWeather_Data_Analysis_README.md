WeatherPy 

Analysis Objective

Objective - Provide visualization and analysis for the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator by utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API.

- Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls
- Include a print log of each city as it processes with city number and name printed.
- Save both a csv file and png images for each scatter plot.

Scatter Plots to be created:

1. Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
2. Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
3. Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
4. Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


Three observable trends:

1. Temperatures appear to be alot warmer or hotter closer to the equator at latitude ranges of 0 to 20 with the hottest temperatures reflecting at the 0 latitude mark. This observation makes sense since the amount of solar energy at a city closer to the equator would be greater. 

2. Wind speed versus latitude appears to show a little increase as you move away from the equator according to the scatter plot. This really does not reflect a strong correlation between wind speed and latitude 

3. As of our current date, in analyzing the humidity and cloud coverage scatter plots, there does not seem to be a strong correlation to latitude. It shows more of an equal distribution across the latitudes at this given time and season.
