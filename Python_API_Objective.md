# Python_API_Challenge


WeatherPy

Objective

Provide visualization and analysis for the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator by utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API.To use the citipy library to find the nearest cities in relation to the random generation of atleast 500 cities.

- Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls
- Include a print log of each city as it processes with city number and name printed.
- Save both a csv file and png images for each scatter plot.

Scatter plots were created to reflect the correlations between:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
